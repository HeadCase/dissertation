## Abstract
Many, if not all, representative democracies utilise geographic boundaries to
define electoral populations. In the system of the United States, on which
this work focuses, these so-called districts are subject to abuse. Partisan
gerrymandering is the process of drawing electoral districts such that they
favour the party authoring the map. With voters changing their political
views, party preference, and even physical location, it can be difficult to
determine if a district is gerrymandered. We seek to answer the question: how
can one identify a partisan gerrymander? To do so, we deploy the sampling
technique of MCMC to sample uniformly at random from the set of all legal
districting plans. This is done using a bespoke library newly written in
``python`` by the author. We leverage this distribution in our analysis of a
suspected gerrymander to assemble evidence to make our case. We find that,
while difficult to prove definitively, enough statistics and tools exist to
  produce a compelling set of evidence for or against a gerrymander claim. We
  use these tools to demonstrate that a proposed districting plan is a
  partisan gerrymander. We conclude with a discussion of additional options
  available for future work.
